This is a sample, written in scala with no other lib dependencies, for playing poker against the oorby.com API.

To use it, compile it with:
scalac SampleBot.scala

and run it:
scala BotRunner botname devkey

This bot just plays randomly. To add in your own poker logic, create your own bot class and implement decideNextAction() (see CallBot and RandomBot for examples). Then, update BotRunner to use your bot instead of RandomBot.
